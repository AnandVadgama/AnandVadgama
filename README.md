## 💭 Philosophy

> "The best way to understand something is to build it from scratch. Every line of code is a step towards deeper understanding."

I believe that true mastery comes from understanding the fundamental principles behind every algorithm and architecture. That's why I focus on implementing everything from the ground up - it's not just about using tools, but about truly comprehending how they work.
